Version 0.1.7
	Forced single threaded Isolate Relevant Pairs
Version 0.1.8
        Forced single threaded extract clips	
        Identical input gives identical output when Multithreading
Version 0.1.9
	Reimplemented isolate read pairs to allow multithreading with deterministic output
        Retained pairs fastq files no longer have redundant read name on line 3
Version 0.2.0
	Add Option --exploratory to reduce the strictness and allow more positive results
Version 0.2.1
        Changes Behaviour of isolate_read_pairs_fq to allow simultaneous reading and writing
        increasing speed and reducing memory consumption.
        Limit placed on number of reads in memory at any one time ~4GB with 150bp reads
