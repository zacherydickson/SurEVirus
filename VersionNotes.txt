Version 0.1.1
	Re-implemented Dependency Version Checking Added Version number to the program
Version 0.1.2
	Improved Logging for cluster_junctions
Version 0.1.3
	Fixed Bug caused by semantic versions with non-numerical parts
Version 0.1.4
	Minor Optimization of outputting candidate regions
Version 0.1.5
	Altered intermediate file structure to speed up processing
Version 0.1.6
	Prevent Hard clipping in BWA to reduce variability
Version 0.1.7
	Forced single threaded Isolate Relevant Pairs
Version 0.1.8
        Forced single threaded extract clips	
        Identical input gives identical output when Multithreading
Version 0.1.9
	Reimplemented isolate read pairs to allow multithreading with deterministic output
        Retained pairs fastq files no longer have redundant read name on line 3
Version 0.2.0
	Add Option --exploratory to reduce the strictness and allow more positive results
Version 0.2.1
        Changes Behaviour of isolate_read_pairs_fq to allow simultaneous reading and writing
        increasing speed and reducing memory consumption.
        Limit placed on number of reads in memory at any one time ~4GB with 150bp reads
Version 0.2.2
        Fixed Bug where reads could be assigned to incorrect junction orientations
        Fixed Bug in reporting the orientation of reads supporting a junction
        Fixed Bug where exploratory mode was locked on
Version 0.2.3
	Bug Fix in creating configuration file around exploratory option
        Prevented spurious warning on naming conventions during adjusting coverage
Version 0.2.4
	Refactor of code to expose shared types
        Change to enumeration of edges which identifies edges where both the host and virus region are subregions of another edges region pair, the sub-edge's reads are assigned to the larger edge and the sub-edge removed
